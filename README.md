# 5 Bits Mini ALU

Welcome to my mini CPU brain, a mini Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) made in WiRedPanda 4.10, a logic circuits simulator developed by students of my university.

This ALU performs 11 operations with two (or one) operators up to 5 bits:

| Op Code in Decimal | Op Code | Operation |
| 0 | 0000 | A - B |
| 1 | 0001 | A = B |
| 2 | 0010 | A > B |
| 3 | 0011 | A < B |
| 4 | 0100 | A + B |
| 5 | 0101 | A ∧ B |
| 6 | 0110 | A ∨ B |
| 7 | 0111 | A ⊻ B |
| 8 | 1000 | A' |
| 9 | 1001 | B' |
| 10 | 1010 | A x B |
